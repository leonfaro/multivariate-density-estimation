#Title:
Estimating Multivariate Continuous Densities via Factorization into Univariate Conditional Densities Using Transformation Forests and Comparison with Normalizing Flows

#Abstract:
This master's thesis explores methods for estimating multivariate continuous probability densities by factorizing them into products of univariate conditional densities. Utilizing the chain rule of probability, any multivariate density can be decomposed into a sequence of univariate conditional densities. Each univariate conditional density is estimated using flexible non-parametric models such as transformation forests and transformation boosting, known for their robustness and ability to capture complex dependencies without extensive hyperparameter tuning. By multiplying these estimated univariate conditional densities, the joint multivariate density is reconstructed. This approach is compared with joint density estimation methods like normalizing flows from the deep learning community, which estimate the multivariate density directly. The thesis aims to investigate whether estimating univariate conditional densities separately offers advantages in terms of flexibility, computational efficiency, and modeling capabilities compared to joint estimation methods. Benchmark datasets, both synthetic (e.g., two-dimensional spirals and higher-dimensional data) and real-world continuous multivariate datasets, will be used to evaluate and compare the methods. Through this comparative study, the thesis seeks to provide insights into the effectiveness of factorization approaches for multivariate density estimation and their practical applicability.

#Summary:

The thesis focuses on estimating multivariate continuous probability densities by decomposing them into univariate conditional densities using the chain rule. The central idea is to model each univariate conditional density separately using methods like transformation forests or transformation boosting, which are flexible and robust non-parametric models. By multiplying these estimated univariate conditional densities, the joint multivariate density is reconstructed. The thesis will compare this factorization approach with joint density estimation methods such as normalizing flows, which estimate the multivariate density directly using deep learning techniques. The goal is to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of estimating univariate conditional densities separately versus estimating the joint density directly. The study involves exploring existing literature, collecting benchmark datasets (both simple and higher-dimensional), implementing the methods, and evaluating them on these datasets to assess their performance in modeling complex multivariate distributions.

The core idea is to explore whether decomposing a multivariate density into univariate conditional densities and estimating them separately provides practical advantages over joint estimation methods. By leveraging flexible models like transformation forests for the univariate conditional densities, the approach aims to capture complex dependencies in multivariate data efficiently. Comparing this with normalizing flows, which estimate the joint density directly, the thesis seeks to understand the trade-offs between the two approaches in terms of modeling capability, computational efficiency, and flexibility.
